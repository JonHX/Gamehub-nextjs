# Next.js 15 Game Collection

This is a collection of fun mini-games built using **Next.js 15**, created as part of self-imposed timeboxed coding challenges. Each game is fully functional but not optimized—these were built for fun, experimentation, and practice rather than perfection.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Next.js 15** – Modern React framework for fast, server-rendered applications
- **React (useState, useEffect, etc.)** – State management and logic handling
- **Tailwind CSS** – Simple and efficient styling
- **TypeScript (where applicable)** – Typed safety for better maintainability

## 🎮 Game Descriptions

### 1️⃣ Click Fast
**The goal:** Click the button as fast as possible when it appears.
- Tests reaction speed by measuring how quickly you click after the button appears.
- Results are stored in a scoreboard.

### 2️⃣ Memory Game
**The goal:** Match all pairs of cards in as few moves as possible.
- A grid-based memory card game where you flip over two cards at a time.
- The game ends when all pairs are matched.

### 3️⃣ Number Guesser
**The goal:** The computer tries to guess your number between 1 and 100.
- You guide the computer by telling it whether the guess is too high or too low.
- The game tracks the number of attempts taken.

### 4️⃣ Word Scrambler
**The goal:** Unscramble the given word as fast as possible.
- The game presents a scrambled word that the player must unscramble.
- Timer records the completion time.

### 5️⃣ Guess My Number
**The goal:** You guess a number between 1 and 100, and the game tells you if it's correct.
- The game provides feedback: "Too high," "Too low," or "Correct!"
- Tracks the number of attempts.

## 🚀 How to Run the Games Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nextjs-games.git
   cd nextjs-games
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```sh
   npm run dev  # or yarn dev
   ```

4. Open the browser and navigate to:
   ```sh
   http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. Select a game from the menu and start playing! 🎉

## ⚠️ Caveat
These games were built in **timeboxed self-tests**, meaning they are not optimized for performance or best coding practices. The primary goal was to **have fun and test myself!**

Enjoy playing! 🚀🎮
